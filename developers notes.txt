MILESTONES

1. (v)BEGUN
2. COMPLETE PLAYABLE CORE
	The first mission(s) will be you in your little rocketship flying short-range errands and deliveries.  
		You will see planets, but nothing about them.
		You will avoid hazards, knowing nothing about them.
		If you die, you are always put back to this mini rocketship
		Mission1: You are asked to fly to a planet X, and are given the course, nothing more.
	You can fly the ship
		(v)AD turn/set course (very slowly)
		(v)W/D set forward thrust
		Set speed (0 to 3)
		(v)BUG: the pivot point is not the center
		little man rotates independently of ship (to always face up)
		BUG: starfield is gross
	Your little man goes back and forth between your 2 components
	Arrival is noted
	Planets are visible
	You have a mission kick off
3. NEXT STEP
	You are given a more involved cargo ship
	Crew wander the ship, AI directing them to give components attention
	Use LMB to select any component, it gets attention, and focuses your camera.
	Zoom levels - exterior/sector map, interior ship map
	Your missions at this level are ...
4. Embellishments
	Main level scrolls with you, but starfield scrolls independently, and there is another level of objects in system that also scroll independently, these are unreachable (sun, gas giants)

MISSION 1:
You've gotten your hands on a very basic rocketship.. A cockpit stuck on a rocket motor.  She isn't very maneuverable or fast, but it's just enough to get from A to B.  Your contract is to deliver cargo to planet-4 of this system.  Your equipment is crude, so just follow a heading of 381.  Good Luck!
